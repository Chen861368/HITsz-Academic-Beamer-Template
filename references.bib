  title = {Optimal Sensor Placement for Reconstructing Wind Pressure Field around Buildings Using Compressed Sensing},
  author = {Luo, Xihaier and Kareem, Ahsan and Yoo, Shinjae},
  abstract = {Deciding how to optimally deploy sensors in a large, complex, and spatially extended structure is critical to ensure that the surface pressure field is accurately captured for subsequent analysis and design. In some cases, reconstruction of missing data is required in downstream tasks such as the development of digital twins. This paper presents a data-driven sparse sensor selection algorithm, aiming to provide the most information contents for reconstructing aerodynamic characteristics of wind pressures over tall building structures parsimoniously. The algorithm first fits a set of basis functions to the training data, then applies a computationally efficient QR algorithm that ranks existing pressure sensors in order of importance based on the state reconstruction to this tailored basis. The findings of this study show that the proposed algorithm successfully reconstructs the aerodynamic characteristics of tall buildings from sparse measurement locations, generating stable and optimal solutions across a range of conditions. As a result, this study serves as a promising first step toward leveraging the success of data-driven and machine learning algorithms to supplement traditional genetic algorithms currently used in wind engineering.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Identifying coordinate transformations that make strongly nonlinear dynamics approximately linear has the potential to enable nonlinear prediction, estimation, and control using linear theory. The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

  abstract = {This work proposes a new formulation for image reconstruction based on the autoencoder framework. The work follows the adaptive approach used in prior dictionary and transform learning based reconstruction techniques. Existing autoencoder based reconstructions are non-adaptive; they are trained on a separate training set and applied on another. In this work, the autoencoder is learnt from the patches of the image it is reconstructing. Experimental studies on MRI reconstruction shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dictionary learning, transform learning and (non-adaptive) autoencoder based approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method that learns traffic as images and predicts large-scale, network-wide traffic speed with a high accuracy. Spatiotemporal traffic dynamics are converted to images describing the time and space relations of traffic flow via a two-dimensional time-space matrix. A CNN is applied to the image following two consecutive steps: abstract traffic feature extraction and network-wide traffic speed prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by taking two real-world transportation networks, the second ring road and north-east transportation network in Beijing, as examples, and comparing the method with four prevailing algorithms, namely, ordinary least squares, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural network, and random forest, and three deep learning architectures, namely, stacked autoencoder, recurrent neural network, and long-short-term memory network. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other algorithms by an average accuracy improvement of 42.91\% within an acceptable execution time. The CNN can train the model in a reasonable time and, thus, is suitable for large-scale transportation networks.},
